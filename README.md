For week 6 challenge,we completed the assignment of using API's with python and its libraries.The assignment had 2 parts.

For first part,We created python script to visualize the weather dats for over 500 cities which were at varying distance from equator.We used OpenWeatherMap API and citipy Python to create the script.Then we created scatter plots to showcase relationship of latitude with temperature,humidity,cloudiness and windspeed from thee cities..Finally we computed linear regression for each relationship by sepearteing data to northern and southern hemispheres.


For second part of assignment, We used Geoapify API,geoViews Python libraray and jupyter notebook.We created map visualizationsfor various cities and then narrowed down the data to our ideal weather and stored the data in a dataframe. Then we located hotels within a radius of 10000 meters of our coordinates and  created map visualization for the hotels.
